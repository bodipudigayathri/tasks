Ghost Matter is an extremely hazardous substance found throughout the Solar System. While invisible to the naked eye, it can be detected by the camera or Little Scout. When photographed, it appears as a blue-green aura in the air.
TL;DR: Ghost Matter is a dangerously cold exotic form of matter. It exists in a state of equilibrium by way of a rapid, reversible reaction/phase-change between the dangerous gas-like phase and the inert crystal phase through deposition and sublimation
There's a simple explanation for how the Hearthians survived the ghost matter; Water is ghost matter's weakness - notice that you'll never find ghost matter underwater, even in areas where it is otherwise everywhere..
